//	Manually Tweaked initial Kp, Ki, Kd values.

// Throttle
// observed behaviour, driving too slow preferably made faster for faster simulation, so increased throttle from given initial 0.3 to 0.8
// Behavior became more abrupt, and vehicle difficult to control. So reduced throttle and reverted back to throttle=0.3

// Manual tweaking. start with kp=kd=ki=0.1 for 10 turns, ie. 0.1, .01, 1.0 

// Noticed vehicle slowly starting to go out of track. During this action, it retains high CTE for many time periods  
// When CTE is high on 1 side of 0 then integral term starts dominating (as sum is increasing). This creates going off path and coming back too late, 
// and then with higher magnitude and intensity; and finally when steer is capped, it doesn't even easily return. 
// To reduce this action, drastically reduced ki from 0.01 to ki=0.001 ; Gave very improved behavior, with only fine tweaking left


// observed behaviour, lot of wobbling, so increase kd significantly kd=2.0

// observed behaviour, slight bias to right, negligible. To overcome this bias, halved ki to ki=0.0005

// For testing repeated iterations with different kp,ki,kd values, parameterized these and read from stdin. 
// This was especially helpful for a lot of failed trials testing using higher values of throttle.
